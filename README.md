A modern implementation of the classic "Bulls and Cows" number guessing game with both CLI and web interfaces powered by Streamlit.

## 🎮 Game Rules

Bulls and Cows is a code-breaking game where:

- The computer generates a secret 4-digit number with unique digits
- You try to guess this number in as few attempts as possible
- After each guess, you get feedback in the form of:
  - **Bulls**: Correct digits in the correct position
  - **Cows**: Correct digits in the wrong position

For example, if the secret number is "7846" and you guess "7814", you get:
- 2 Bulls (7 and 4 are in the correct position)
- 1 Cow (8 is correct but in the wrong position)

## 🚀 Features

- Two game interfaces: CLI for quick play and Streamlit web app for a richer experience
- Interactive feedback and guess history
- Game statistics tracking
- Clean, modern UI in the web version

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- For the web app: Streamlit
